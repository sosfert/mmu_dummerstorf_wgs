# WGS analysis of the Dummerstorf mouse lines

This repository contains the scripts used to analyse whole genome sequencing data of the Dummerstorf mouse lines. The analysis starts from raw sequences and ends with multiple analysis to characterize each mice line in terms of genetic differentiation, admixture, genomewide similarities and structural variation.
