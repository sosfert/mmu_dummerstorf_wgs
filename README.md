# WGS analysis of the Dummerstorf mouse lines

This repository contains the scripts used to analyse whole genome sequencing data of the Dummerstorf mouse lines. The analysis starts from raw sequences and ends with multiple analysis to characterize each line of mice in terms of genetic differentiation, admixture and genomewide similarities.
